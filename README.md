# 6.5840-rustlab

This is the Rust version of [MIT 6.5840(or 6.824) lab](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/). The original lab is written in Golang, I reimplemented it in Rust so Rustaceans can finish the lab in Rust.

Currently I only finished the code of lab3, which is about the Raft algorithm, cause it's the most significant part of this lab. The reason I only completed lab3 is I spent a lot of time actually implementing lab3. Even though I have implemented it in Golang before. You can check out the `impl` branch to see my implementations if you want. All tests have passed.

I may add lab4 and lab5 code in future.
